## Mission

KodLabbet is on a mission to empower kids in Swedish schools with coding skills, all while nurturing a genuine passion for programming. Our primary focus revolves around the development and deployment of an educational web tool. Currently, it is exclusively in use within Swedish schools, but we have future plans to extend its accessibility to private users in Sweden.

## Projects and Activities

Our flagship project is a purpose-built web tool, initially tailored for educational use within schools. As we continue to refine and expand its capabilities, our vision is to make it accessible to a wider audience.

## Target Audience

**Schools:** Our primary audience comprises schools in Sweden. However, we aspire to engage with private users who share an interest in introducing coding to children.

## Contact

## Team

KodLabbet is fueled by the passion of four individuals currently in gymnasiet (high school), driving this initiative forward as their UF f√∂retag (Young Enterprise).
